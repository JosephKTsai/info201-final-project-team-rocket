# Info 201 Final Project
## Outpatient Efficiency for Selected Measures
**By: Matt Howard, Liuis Jiang, Akshat Aggarwal, Joseph Tsai**

Our final project uses data from the [State Efficiency Data](https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Outpatient-Imaging-Efficiency-State/if5v-4x48)
and the [National Physician Data](https://data.medicare.gov/Physician-Compare/Physician-Compare-National-Downloadable-File/mj5m-pzi6)
from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Using this data, we examined the efficiencies of different types of outpatient imaging
and the number of radiologists in each state.

We decided that we wanted to make it easy for patients looking for physicians in their state,
by making it really easy to see the best hospitals near them, for their specific issue.

We also included our inquiry into seeing if the number of radiologists affects the efficiency for the chosen measure as a whole and how that inquiry relates to patients.
